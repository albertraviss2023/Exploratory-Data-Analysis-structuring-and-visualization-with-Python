# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-structuring-and-visualization-with-Python
The goal of this project is to we perform structuring and performing an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. The data structuring will help us transform the data for better
analysis since especially when dealing with aspects of date and time.  


## General instructions:
This Code Project provides the code that can be used to merge datasets, perform weighted tabulations, recode data, compute indicators,  as well as the standard tables to produce report on World urban slum population. The code is organized into one single file in the parent folder and all guidelines from the Guide to DHS Statistics have been followed.  The folder "Crosstables with Ch2 tests" contains a sample of cross tables that will be produced if the code is run properly. These cross tables can also be used to study association between variables using the ch2 test statistic.  

## Main files:
The folder contains 2 .ipynb jupyter Notebook Files from which the user can run all the code. The user needs to set the paths for the .csv data file correctly. 

## Data
We are working with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help us draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, we will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you find in the dataset. 


## Jupyter Installation
User needs to have jupyter Notebooks installed in order to run the code in the .ipynb files
