# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-structuring-and-visualization-with-Python
The goal of this project is to we perform structuring and performing an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. The data structuring will help us transform the data for better analysis, especially when dealing with aspects of date and time.  

## General instructions:
This Code Project provides python code to structure data, and make it ready for EDA. The project also provides code for performing EDA. The code is organized into two files in the folder.   

## Main files:
The folder contains 2 .ipynb jupyter Notebook Files from which the user can run all the code. The user needs to set the paths for the .csv data file correctly. 

## Data
We are working with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring the data in ways that will help us draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, we will draw conclusions about what significant trends or patterns you find in the dataset. 


## Jupyter Installation
User needs to have jupyter Notebooks installed in order to run the code in the .ipynb files
